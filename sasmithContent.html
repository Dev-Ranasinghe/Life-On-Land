    <div class="overview-data">
        <p class="overview-description">Forests play a crucial role in reducing the risks of natural disasters such as floods, 
            droughts, and landslides. They are vital in mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration, contributing to 
            the balance of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and humidity in the air. Forests also protect watersheds, which are essential as 
            they supply 75% of the world's freshwater. From an economic and social perspective, forests are indispensable. 
            Approximately 1.6 billion people, including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures, rely on forests for their livelihoods. 
            Forests provide shelter, jobs, and security for forest-dependent communities, significantly supporting the rural poor, 
            youth, and women. <br><br> The XIV World Forestry Congress in Durban in 2015 highlighted the future of forests in sustainable 
            development. It called for new partnerships across various sectors such as agriculture, finance, energy, and water, as well 
            as greater engagement with indigenous peoples and local communities. The UN Secretary-General emphasized the need for 
            political commitment, smart policies, effective law enforcement, innovative partnerships, and funding to ensure forest 
            conservation.Initiatives like the International Day of Forests, launched in 2013, and the International Year of Forests 
            in 2011 aimed to raise awareness about the importance of forests. These efforts underscore the global commitment to 
            preserving and sustainably managing forest resources. <br><br> The Rio+20 Conference's outcome document, "The Future We 
            Want," and Agenda 21's Chapter 11, emphasize the significance of sustainable forest management in improving livelihoods 
            and promoting international policy coordination. Key objectives include strengthening national institutions related to 
            forests, enhancing activities for the management and conservation of forests, and improving human, technical, and 
            professional skills to implement effective policies and programs for sustainable forest development. These frameworks 
            highlight the importance of integrating sustainable forest management into economic policy and decision-making, ensuring 
            that forests' ecological, economic, social, and cultural roles are supported and preserved.</p>

    <h2 class="section-main-title" id="anchor-id-2">Why do forests matter?</h2>

    <div class="section-data">
        <p class="section-description">These ecosystems are not only the home to over half of the world’s terrestrial species 
            but also play a pivotal role in combating climate change through their natural processes of carbon sequestration. 
            Known as forest mitigation, this process is essential in reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the 
            atmosphere. Recognizing forests' role in achieving a 
            sustainable future is crucial, especially in the context of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This goal is 
            unattainable without significant contributions from forests, which can be realized through ending deforestation 
            and enhancing forest management and reforestation efforts. The world faces the challenge 
            of ongoing deforestation, which is a major contributor to as much as 21% of total greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
